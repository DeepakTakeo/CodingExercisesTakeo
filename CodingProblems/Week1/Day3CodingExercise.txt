Exercise 6: Design a calulator which perform a set of operations dynamically.
Scenario: Design a Calculator class. Take inpit from user like :
          Enter first number = 5
          Enter Second number = 5
          Enter Operation you want to perform = +
     
Outupt of Program will be like this :

          Output: 5+5 = 10;

Hint :   take input by using Scanner class
         take operation(+,-,*,/) as String input from the console
         use if else cases to compare operation with constant String like : final String SUM = "+"; similar for other
         then inside if do the required operation
         print the output.
