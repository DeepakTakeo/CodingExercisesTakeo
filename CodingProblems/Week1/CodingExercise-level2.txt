Exercise 1: Temperature Conversion
Scenario: You are building a weather application, and you need to implement a feature that converts temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Given : You can take temperature of your city in Celsisus.
Task: Write a program that converts Celsisus to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 9/5) + 32, and prints the converted temperature.
// use proper data type for this as we can have decimal value there.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Currency Converter
Scenario: You are developing a currency converter application, and you need to implement a feature that converts a given amount in one currency to another currency.
Given : USD value = 10
Task: Write a program that converts currency to another currency based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate should be stored as a constant variable. Print the converted amount.
//you can convert USD-Rupees and use proper data type

-------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 3: Total Bill Calculation
Scenario: You are developing a restaurant bill calculation application. You need to implement a feature that calculates the total bill amount, including tax and tip.
Given : Bill amount = 30, Taxes = 15, Tip  = 10
Task: Write a program that calculates the total bill amount by adding the bill amount, tax and tip.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 4: Student Grading

Scenario: You are developing a student grading application for a teacher. You need to implement a feature that calculates the average grade of students in a class.
Given : Grades for Five Students as : 8,9,5,4,8
Task: Write a program that calculates their average grade. Print the average grade.
// here also use appropriate data type.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 5: Calculate Area of a Rectangle
Scenario: You are designing a floor planning tool, and you need to calculate the area of a rectangle-shaped room.
Given : Take length as 20 and breadth as 40.
Task: Write a program that will calculates rectangle area. Print the calculated area.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Exercise 6: Design a calulator which perform a set of operations dynamically.
Scenario: Design a Calculator class. Take inpit from user like :
          Enter first number = 5
          Enter Second number = 5
          Enter Operation you want to perform = +
     
Outupt of Program will be like this :

          Output: 5+5 = 10;

Hint :   take input by using Scanner class
         take operation(+,-,*,/) as String input from the console
         use if else cases to compare operation with constant String like : final String SUM = "+"; similar for other
         then inside if do the required operation
         print the output.
