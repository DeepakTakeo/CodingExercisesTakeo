Exercise 1: Simple Interest Calculator

Write a Java program that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period provided by the user.

Instructions:

Use the Scanner class to take input from the user for the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period (in years).
Calculate the simple interest using the formula: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.
Display the calculated simple interest to the user.

Ex: Enter the principal amount: 5000
    Enter the rate of interest: 8.5
    Enter the time period (in years): 2
    Simple Interest: 850.0

Exercise 2: Grade Calculator

Write a Java program that calculates the grade based on the marks obtained by a student in an exam. The program should follow the standard grading system: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

Instructions:

Use the Scanner class to take input from the user for the marks obtained.
Determine the grade based on the marks using if-else statements.
Display the calculated grade to the user.

Ex: Enter the marks obtained: 85
    Grade: B

Exercise 3: Day of the Week

Write a Java program that takes a number representing a day of the week (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.) and displays the corresponding day's name.

Instructions:

Use the Scanner class to take input from the user for the number representing the day of the week.
Implement a switch statement to display the corresponding day's name.
Display the day's name to the user.

Ex : Enter a number (1-7) representing the day of the week: 3
     Day of the week: Tuesday

Exercise 4: Power Calculation

Write a Java program that calculates the power of a given number raised to an exponent provided by the user.

Instructions:

Use the Scanner class to take input from the user for the base number and the exponent.
Use a loop to calculate the power of the number raised to the exponent.
Display the result to the user.

Ex: Enter the base number: 2
    Enter the exponent: 5
    2^5 = 32

Exercise 5: BMI(Body Mass Index) Calculator

Write a Java program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height.

Instructions:

Use the Scanner class to take input from the user for their weight in kilograms and height in meters.
Create a method that takes the input weight and height as arguments and calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).

Ex:  Enter your weight (kg): 70
     Enter your height (m): 1.75
     Your BMI: 22.86
