************* Please create separate classes with proper nomenclature for each exercise **********************

Exercise 1: Temperature Conversion
Scenario: You are building a weather application, and you need to implement a feature that converts temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Given : You can take temperature of your city in Celsisus.
Task: Write a program that converts Celsisus to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 9/5) + 32, and prints the converted temperature.
// use proper data type for this as we can have decimal value there.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Currency Converter
Scenario: You are developing a currency converter application, and you need to implement a feature that converts a given amount in one currency to another currency.
Given : USD value = 10
Task: Write a program that converts currency to another currency based on the exchange rate. The exchange rate should be stored as a constant variable. Print the converted amount.
//you can convert USD-Rupees and use proper data type

-------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 3: Total Bill Calculation
