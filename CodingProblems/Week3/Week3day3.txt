Exercise 1 : Task
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: 0).
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, . fine = 15$ per day after return date
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the . fine = 500$ per month after return month
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine  = 1000$

Ex : d1,m1,y1 = 12 02 2014  -- returned date
     d2,m2,y2 = 12 02 2014  -- due date
     output -- fine = 0

     d1,m1,y1 = 12 02 2014  -- returned date
     d2,m2,y2 = 12 02 2015  -- due date
     output -- fine = 1000$

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective dd, mm, and yyyy  on which the book was actually returned.
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective dd, mm , and yyyy on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
9 6 2015    day = 9, month = 6, year = 2015 (date returned)
6 6 2015    day = 6, month = 6, year = 2015 (date due)

Exercise 2: Write a program in java to find SmallestPositiveInt in an array.
Ex: {-2,0,3,4,1,9}  -> output will be 1

hint : The variable smallestPositiveInt is initialized to 1 because the smallest positive integer in an array must be greater than or equal to 1.
The loop in the program iterates through the array from 0 to array.length - 1. This is because the smallest positive integer in an array must be one of the elements in the array.
The condition array[i] > 0 && array[i] <= smallestPositiveInt checks if the element at index i is greater than 0 and less than or equal to smallestPositiveInt. If the condition is true, then the element at index i is the smallest positive integer in the array.
The variable smallestPositiveInt is updated to the value of the element at index i if the condition array[i] > 0 && array[i] <= smallestPositiveInt is true.
The program returns the value of smallestPositiveInt.

Exercise 3: Write a program in java to find maximum of numbers that will be inputed by user.
Ex: 3,5,6  : output will be 6
Hint : just use set of comparisons between numbers.

Exercise 4: Write an application that reads two integers, determines whether the first is a multiple of the second and
Ex : 5,10 : yes
prints the result. [Hint: Use the remainder operator.]
